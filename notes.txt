    runs two programs:
    Local (Git)
    Cloud (Github)
    
    create account on github

    master branches
    to create branch → F1 or View →  Command palette → Git: Checkout to... → Create new branch → give a name to the branch
    always check on which branch you working
    
    how to back to master branch?
    F1 or View →  Command palette → Git: Checkout to... → choose master branch

    how to switch between branches?
    F1 or View →  Command palette → Git: Checkout to... → and bellow will be displayed your branches

    how to merge changes (add changes) from branch to master branch?
    F1 or View →  Command palette → Git: Merge branch

    OR

    it can be done localy from github Website using Pull request (it  have addition functionalites which allow to check if merging have conflicts or no)
    keep merged branch for a while, but it better to delete to keep it cleaner (manualy in github website)

    (check what is netlify)

  to see merged changes from github website we need to do additional step in vscode:
  click on 3 dots which you will see bellow menu Source Control bar.

    Commit push
    pull
    git bash 

    some git commands in terminal
    git --version
    git config --global --list
    git config --global user.name "Your Name"
    git config --global user.email "Your Email"

    to quit type :q + Enter

    git log

    git checkout -
    git init >initialize local git repo
    git add <file> >add file(s) to staging area 
    git status > Check status of working area
    git push -u origin master >Push to remote repo
    git pull >Pull latest from remote repogit cline >Cline remote repo locally
    git branch <branch name> create a new branch 
    git checkout <branch name> >switch to a branch 
    git checkout -b 'branch name' >create branch if it is not there
    git merge <branch name> >Merge a branch with another | you must do this from master branch
    git add .
    git commit  -m 'your comment here'
    git rm --cashed fileName.html

    some commands on git bash
    touch index.html
    touch app.js
    touch .gitignore
    touch log.txt
    touch README.md


    
    CREATE SNIPPETS like console.log():
      File → Preferences → User snippets → 
      New global snippets file... → give a name (ex. myCustomSnippets) 
      - see example and uncomment, change shortcut name.

    SHORT CUTS:
      alt + ↓  move whole line down or up
      alt + shift + ↓ copy lines
      ctl + shift + arrow highlight fast
      ctl + l highlight whole line (better line select extention)
      crlt + [ arba ]

      shift  + alt + A comment block comment
      ctrl + / (from keyboard) slash comment
      ctrl + ` open terminal
      ctrl + enter is naujos eilutes
      shift + cmd + \

  INCLUDE  - shows errors and still run code
  INCLUDE_ONCE  - if I will include 2 times the same file ir wont include it two times
  REQUIRE - shows error but do not rest of code
  REQUIRE_ONCE


Super Globals
  GLOBALS  - access variable anywhere in PHP
  $_POST  - collect data from HTML after submiting it, data does not visible in query string
  $_GET - like $_POST but you can see it
  $_SERVER - 
  $_COOKIE
  $_SESSION
  $_FILES

  DATABASE
    what is DB? Structured set of data
    what is MySQL? Open-source relational database, Structured Query language (SQL)
    Why to use a DB? Fast/reliable/easy
    What is a Query? Request to retrieve information, extract data from a DB and formats it into a human readable form
    Examples:
      show phpmyAdmin
      create DB 
      create table / id, types, leanth, autoincrement, primary
      Queries:
    1. SELECT * FROM users
    2. DROP table users
    3. create table users(
        id int(11) not null PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
        username VARCHAR(255) not null,
        password VARCHARR(255) not null
      );
    4. INSERT TO users (username, password) VALUES ('John', '12345'), ('Bob', '98765') 
    5. SELECT username FROM users
    6. SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'John'
    7. SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'John' OR id = 4

    8. UPDATE users 
       SET username = 'John', password = 'newPassword123'
       WHERE id = 2

    9. DELETE FROM users
       WHERE id = 2 OR username = 'John';

    10. SELECT * FROM users
        ORDER BY id DESC (means decending, or ASC stands for Ascending)

CLASSES AND OOP 
PHP CLASES 
public, private
constructors
instace object
get and set methods for parameters
magic methods
access modifiers: 
  Public - easy access 
  Private - can be access only though class itself
  Protected - 
inherits / extends
namaspaces
PHP interface
  You should use extend when you have two similar classes, but one has some additional features.
  You need to use interface when you want to define what your classes must do, but the classes can decide themselves how to do that.
PHP abstract

COMPOSER:
What it is? What it does? What for?
Type in CLI: composer 
www.getcomposer.org
Download
Click → Composer.Setup.exe
Install composer and follow instructios 
C:\xamp\php/php.exe // check where will be composer installed, composer runs woth php, it is important
after instalation you can check in CML if composer was installed
right in CLI: composer
clear CML
now we need navigate composer to our project
copy folder path where project is created
example: project folder paths is C:\xampp\htdocs\Trainings
open CML
type: cd C:\xampp\htdocs\Trainings
enter
when we are in the project right directory type:
composer init 
system will ask couple questions - just click Enter for each question
After all questions you will see coposer.json file in your projectfile next to index.php
add some code to composer.json file
"autoload": {
  "psr-4": {
    "app\\": "./app"  // first word app revering to namespace name, and direction where namespace is mapped, under app folder all the Clases will be under app namespace  
  }
}

after editing composer.json file you need to update composer via terminal
open CLI
right: composer update
after updating you will see new vendor folder

after this updates you do not need use require_once function, because composer will take care of such classes connection
but we need require_once one file in the index.php file which is - require_once "./vendor/autoload.php"
we do not need to write requite_once 100 times , fixes dependecy management problem

Some packages which yoi can install with composer.
